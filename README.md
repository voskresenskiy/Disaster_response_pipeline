# Disaster response pipeline

## Project motivation 

The current project is done in the framework of the [Data Scientist Nanodegree at Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) and includes two main goals:
- to develop a pipeline that handles disaster data provided by [Figure Eight](https://appen.com/) and builds model predicting the category of a disaster message;
- to make an application that allows an user to predict a category for any new message.
